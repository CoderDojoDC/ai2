# Installing App Inventor 2 on Mac OS

1. Go to http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/mac.html;
2. Follow the AI2 installation instructions beginning with "Download the Installer";
  1. You may need to update the security settings on your Mac in order to install software downloaded outside of the App Store; 
  2. To do so, go to "System Preferences" --> "Security and Privacy", and choose "Allow Apps Downloaded from Mac App Store and Identified Developers";
  3. Having done this, you can now right-click on the downloaded AI2 software, and choose "open" in order to bypass the installation gatekeeper (rather than double clicking the .dmg file to install);
4. After setup is complete, go to http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu;
5. In the app inventor menu bar, choose "Connect" --> "Emulator";
6. The emulator should launch in a second window automatically;
